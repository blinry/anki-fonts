    history: Commissioned by GQ in 2000, American type foundry Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones looked to collected typography specimens from around New York as their source of inspiration for a typeface that had to be versatile but not imposing, and modern yet nostalgic. Being wider than average text, it lends itself gravity and solidity. It says, “What I’m saying is special enough to warrant the extra room I require.”
