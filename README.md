This is a set of flashcards for the popular open-source spaced repetition software [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), which will teach you to identify the most popular typefaces. It showcases **over 45 fonts**, each with a short *history* and a list of *defining characteristics*.

The basis for these flashcards is the now-defunct [FontSpotting deck](https://web.archive.org/web/20130913113525/http://fontspotting.org) developed by Dustin de Souza and Jessica Witt. The content is used with their kind permission.
